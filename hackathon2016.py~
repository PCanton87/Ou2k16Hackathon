#Ou physics hackathon 2k16

#Theme: An adventure.  Possibly a game or a story

#Some notes were taking in my windows 10 parition, after installing python there
#Quickly found windows command prompt functional but cumbersome and ill documented
#Difficult to get python and command prompt line to work together, installing packages, etc
#So, here we are in Fedora

#Goals:
#

#So far, rather than getting data off a webpage we found a package that could play a video from an html link
#So, a little different than what I need to learn for yahoo finace.   

#Wanted to learn how to do an interactive plot - like you have in iraf

#Call and run an old (IDL) script, possibly via the command line.
#I would like to wrap my python codes and kurtis' IDL calc_mass code into an IFMR pipeline
#Need to call kurtis' code somehow, else id have to rewrite it all in python






#Tim and I wanted to do a game, sieging NH (ie black holes you fall into behind doors, etc).  Quickly found it
#would be complicated to write a lot in a weekend,
#and around our goals of things to learn settled on sieging gittenger hall with a trebuchet which is currently
#being demonlished anyhow. 

#Interactive gui could select parameter space in trebuchets draw and angle of fire.  Theres some physics for ya

#Use monty python clips for triumph or defeat if you hit or miss the building



#Challagne is to get an interactive plot.  Could query user for input angle and initial speed f we cant get this
#to work.
