README inagural 2016 Ou physics & astronomy dept hackathon project
Paul Canton & Tim Miller

For this hackathon, we were challenged with designing an adventure. At the time of assignment, the building next to the Physics & Astronomy department was being torn down to make room for a second Physics & Astronomy department building. A natural adventure which would include some physics would be to get in on demonishing this building... in a fun way!  We implimented some well known projectile motion equations of motion to simulate launching a trebuchet striking the building, assumed to be a few meters tall.  THe user input initial speed and launch angle of the projectile.  When it, an over the top nuclear explosion video plays over a photo of the building to be demolished. If missed, a series of monty python french taunter clips are played, one for each time you miss.

One will need vlc, a video player than can run .webm video files.

Enjoy
